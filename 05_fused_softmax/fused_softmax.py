This "fused softmax" kernel only works on matrices whose rows fit in the GPU's SRAM.

What you'll learn:
- The importance of reducing memory reads/writes
- How to fuse multiple operations into one kernel to reduce memory reads/writes
- How to fetch GPU specifications
- Some parts of the GPU architecture that you don't usually have to think about 
    when writing Triton kernels
- How to define meta-parameters using GPU-specific attributes and rough heuristics
- Pipeline parallelism & the weird way that for-loops work within GPU kernels
- How to choose the value of extra entries when masking

Recommended order to read the code in:
Step 1 - naive implementation
Step 2 - unit test
Step 3 - wrapper
Step 4 - kernel
Step 5 - benchmark

    overflows when doing .exp(); softmax is invariant to this shift
    '''
    # read MN elements, find their max along N, and write M elements (the maxes)
    x_max = x.max(dim=1)[0] 
        # pytorch actually outputs a tuple of (values, indices) so [0] grabs the values;
        # we ignored the indices when talking about memory writes above
    # read MN + M elements, subtraction is MN flops, and write MN elements
    z = x - x_max[:, None]
    # read MN elements and write MN elemnts
    numerator = torch.exp(z)
        # exp is actually a lot of flops per element but we're only worried about mem ops rn
    # read MN elements, do MN flops to find M sum values, and then write M elements
    denominator = numerator.sum(dim=1)
    # read MN + M elements, division is MN flops, then write MN elements
    out = numerator / denominator[:, None]

that's a whole lot of memory operations. we'd prefer to have a custom "fused" kernel that only 
reads x from DRAM once and does all the necessary computations on SRAM as opposed to repeatedly 
reading & writing to DRAM. that would give a ~4x speedup since 
(8MN + 4M)/2MN = 4 (ignoring the solo M term a la big O notation)

torch.jit.script flag and torch.compile actually aim to do this fusion automatically but can't 
pull it off quite as well as we're about to

our fused softmax kernel will work as follows:
each program (individual call of the kernel) loads a set of rows of the input matrix X which are
  strided by number of programs, softmaxes it and writes back the result to the output Y

note an important limitation of Triton is that each block must have a power-of-two number of
  elements, so we need to internally "pad" each row and guard the memory operations properly
